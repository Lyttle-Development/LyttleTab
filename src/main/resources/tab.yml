# Dynamic, fully configurable sorting (object, not list)
# Rules are evaluated top-to-bottom; the first rule that produces a difference decides.
# Available rule types and their required fields:
# - type: placeholder
#     placeholder: "<any PAPI placeholder>"            # required
#     order: [val1, val2, ...]                         # optional explicit value priority list; unknown values go after and are A->Z
# - type: group
#     order: [group1, group2, ...]                     # required group priority list
#     NOTES:
#       - Groups are detected generically via permissions like "group.<name>" or "luckperms.group.<name>" (LuckPerms compatible).
# - type: placeholder_a_to_z
#     placeholder: "<any PAPI placeholder>"            # required (e.g., "%player%", "%luckperms_primary_group_name%")
#     order: asc|desc                                  # required direction; "asc" = A->Z, "desc" = Z->A; empty values sort last
#
# Extra notes:
# - You can use any valid PAPI placeholder; nothing is hardcoded.
# - If multiple rules are defined, they are used as tie-breakers in order.
# - Unknown placeholder values (not in 'order') are placed after explicit values, then compared alphabetically.
